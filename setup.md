title: Setup
---

To follow the Lesson Development Study Groups program,
you will need:

- [A GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- A lesson repository in [The Carpentries Incubator][incubator].
  Proposing your lesson to the Incubator is one of the first homework tasks.
- A local Bundler installation, to build and preview lesson pages locally.
  Please follow [the instructions on The Carpentries Lesson Example](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html#setup-for-local-rendering-of-the-lessons-optional).
  This setup is a homework task in Week 3 of the program,
  but participants might find it useful to have local builds set up before then.

## Agenda

1. Welcome & Icebreaker 
    - ***What is your favorite Icebreaker question?*** This is meta (and hopefully helpful for following Discussion Leads)
    - Mike welcomed the group and asked participants to articulate their icebreaker questions
    - Mateusz: favourite superpower or superpower people would like to have
    - Aleks: I like questions about what food people are making at the moment or like, e.g. favourite icecream flavours:-)
    - Batool: I love the icebreaker questions we have on the turing way book dash. I'll post the link later on.
    - Shrirang: I like question and see how people react to questions on variety of topics mostly technological ; gauge their confidence levels.
    - Serah: what made you laugh most recently, and share a link to some good ideas: https://museumhack.com/list-icebreakers-questions/
    - Nora: This or That activities are fun https://www.careercontessa.com/advice/icebreaker-questions/
    - Mark: where would be a good place to go for good beer/good coffee locally where people are
    - Joni: Favourite aircraft

1. Follow up on last week's homework assignments:
    - Mike briefed about expectations of the previous weeks assignments. 
    - Nora & Daniel remarked on whether or not their Learner Profile completely fit the carpentries expectations/model. Nora said she noticed the guidance emphasized focusing on defining "skills" for your learner, rather than "topics", however she felt like the nature of her group's Introductory lesson is more focused on introducing foundational topics such as ethics in AI, using this lesson as a jumping off point for more hands-on, specific data skills
    -  Joni spoke about challenges in areospace domain with a knowledge of programming in Python as well as the motivation to do so.
    - Lesson Design Notes (with a Learner Profile)
        - Joni finds it hard to imagine pilots or maintainers wanting to take up programming - university education is also uncommon in the field, which presents an added challenge in creating the profiles.  However the exercise was useful in expressing the likely key deficencies that would need to be addressed.
        - Batool shares the same issue, as assumptions are made for who can take the course being developed - it proved a useful exercise to develop learner profiles and think of edge cases
        - Aleks: The Carpentries is trying to come up with ways to present these skills in a way that people will find immediately useful i.e. what are the smaller tasks that need to happen for people to motivate learners, make work with data more efficient, etc?

1. Questions or clarifications about assigned reading? ([Chapter 3 - Deciding what to teach](https://cdh.carpentries.org/deciding-what-to-teach.html))
    - 3.1: Target Audience
    - 3.2: Skills List
    - 3.3: Example using a Software Carpentry Learner Profile
        - Shrirang: Are we looking at generalisations of specific domains when developing materials?
            - Daniel: Depends on the material, can be tricky to target as audiences differ, easier when audience is enthusiatics and not sceptical over a topic (e.g. keen on python vs sceptical over a machine learning) - be aware that people can come as vaguely curious about a topic but sceptical - a real life example from a Library Carpentry workshop 
            - Elnaz: people sometimes come to them to learn just a UI tool or a specific package in R or Python, e.g. bioconductor. Also the motivation levels of participants may at time depends on the tools or languages.
            - Mateusz: easier to be more specific, also for challenges in your lesson - easier to motivate the audience by showing them how this will help them in their daily challenges. They are not here to learn R - they are here to solve their researh problem and you need to convince them this is the way to go.
            - Nora: did not realise she had particular people in mind with a particular skillset - initially thought her lesson is for everyone in the world. Found this a good exercise and being more specific.
            - Mike: we are really teaching for one specific person (metaphorically) and the skillset we want them to have
    

1. Discussion Questions:
    - What are some of the potential benefits of writing specific learner profiles rather than stopping after answering the audience definition questions?
        - Joni: Variety of learners are usually present; so baseline skills determination are important. A might be proficent in skill 1 but not in 2 & 3, B might be proficent in 1&3 but not 2 etc.  By the end of the course all most be proficent in the course objective skills. Diffferent profiles can help to express how each might differe and what types of teaching might be needed to bring all up to standard.
        - Mark: hard juggling act to keep everyone entertained, speaking from his experience of teaching people machine learning - the common thing is that do not know anything about ML but have varying software engineering skills 
        - Aleks: you cannot satisfy everyone, especially not when creating a lesson and teaching it - you have to work to find a common goal that aligns with the needs of most
        - Shrirang: communicate objectives clearly, and share a list of prerequisites as a way to help people understand what your lesson addresses. 
        - Nora: prerequisites are very useful for situating learners and defining course expectations (athough even with best efforts people still come to the workshop with different expectations from what was communicated). You could use elements that have cropped up from Learner Profiles (or even the whole thing) to also help signpost who the lesson is for ("Are you tired of excel? Want to automate your processes...this course is for you!") 
        - Aleks (in chat): learner profiles are more for lesson developers initially and as Mateusz pointed out they inform the prerequsites  - prerequistes are also to help you communicate clearly the level of the workshop to your audence - learner profiles will also help the audience to self-identify with who your lesson is for and how it will help them 
        - Mateusz: Learner profiles allow people to identify themselves in the lesson design, and are a good precursor to writing prerequisites which when communicated to your audience, help to get the right set of learners into your learning environment 

    - What are some of the potential downsides to being very specific about learner profiles?
    - Did characterising its target audience change how you plan to approach writing your lesson?
        - Elnaz: in carpentries workshops you have pre-workshop surveys that can help you modify the curriculum you will deliver - e.g. remove some bits or covering other bits in more detail. The same strategy can be used in lesson development - based on the learners' levels one can modify the material being developed - as Mike put it: "either being reactive or do a bit more advance planning".
        - Joni:Juggling between domain specific knowledge requirements and programming knowledge requirements before the course starts.  Both can cause the student to struggle. 
    - What are some of the challenges of writing a lesson aimed at people with some prior knowledge of the topic domain e.g. an intermediate programming lesson?
        - Batool: how much introduction to do at the beginning, from example of learning single RNASeq and ... RNASeq - people sometimes come with misconceptions
        - Daniel - be specific about the definition of concepts you want people to know about before coming to the lesson rather than saying "intermediate Python" which can mean different thing to different people 
        - Shrirang: more polished concepts - to motivate more intermediate learners
    - How do you come up with a Skills List for a concept-based lesson?
        
1. Go over next week's Homework Assignment, and ask questions:
      - Read the [Technological Introductions chapter of the CDH](https://cdh.carpentries.org/technological-introductions.html) and follow the steps to set up your repository as described in the template README file.
      - Read [section A.2 of CDH Appendix A: The Carpentries Incubator](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-carpentries-incubator.html), and add topics to your lesson repository. (If you cannot add the complete set of topic tags yet, do not worry: you will be able to add more and remove topics whenever you like.)
      - Note down any questions you have about the lesson template and, if you got stuck, how far you had progressed with the setup beforehand.
      - Add a link to your lesson repository to the Study Group’s shared notes document.

**Instead of deleting, I kept this instruction box from the Study Group agenda template, so that future Discussion Leads know what to expect...**
:::info
The Discussion Lead should **delete this box** and fill in their planned agenda here: this should include an overview of the key points you wish to cover and/or the questions you would like to ask the group during the discussion. 

You might choose to include one or more of the suggested Discussion Prompts from the episode page for this week on the [Study Groups site](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/study-groups/index.html), but you are also free to design your own agenda and set your own prompts for the discussion.

Discussion Leads may choose to assign timings (5 mins, 10 mins, etc) to points on the agenda to ensure the discussion keeps moving (and consider assigning a time keeper to track this schedule), or let the conversation lead where it may. 

You might ask all group members to write their responses to prompts before asking for volunteers to verbalise their thoughts to the group, or you might prefer to facilitate a spoken discussion for the duration of the call.

Whatever you do, remember that the Discussion Lead's main responisibility is to keep the discussion moving and to ensure that every member of the group has the opportunity to contribute to the discussion.

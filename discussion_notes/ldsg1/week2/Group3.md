## Agenda

A note of apology from Toby - I have no idea why you all receive a new calendar invitation every time I edit an event, and I'm sorry for the spam to all your inboxes!

1. Welcome & Icebreaker 
    - Please sign in by adding your details to the Participants section above.
    - Do you like snow? Why or why not? Suggest few things postive or not below:
    - [name=Richard] Yes; we don't get much but fun when we do.
    - [name=Bailey] Yes; but I'm from Texas, originally, so it's always kind of a novelty for me.
    - [name=Alessio] I do like snow, everything feels more winter-like with snow, and it reminds me of mountains.
    - [name=Graeme] Yes, but I get tired of it very quickly. Especially as my street isn't cleared of snow by the council.
    - [name=Sarah] Love when the trees are snow covered, less so the streets
    - [name=Annajiat] I don't get snow but I guess, initially it would be fun, then may be a bit of adaptation followed by enjoying it again! Cold is an issue but it might be helpful to play around as well!
    - [name=Jannetta] I do but I don't like the cold!
    - [name=Hanno] Yes, I do. 
    - [name=Toby] if I can ski on it, yes. if it is stopping me from getting where I want to go, not so much...


    

Facilitator tip from Sarah, if you want folks to type answers in shared docs, provide space by adding lines for them to reply.

Toby isn't so keen on snow when it causes problems. Bailey reporting snow is causing problems in Texas for family at home.

2.  Questions or clarifications about assigned reading? (Chapter 3 - Deciding what to teach)
 -    Richard - not sure where to post the lesson profiles set for homework. Bailey added a link to the previous week's notes, 
         -    Toby confirmed this is what we should do. The notes are posted on GitHub, but we can still add the links to the CodiMD and they will be merged into the version on GitHub. Toby asked all the group to do this.

3.  Discussions:
    - What did you find challenging about writing learner profiles?
        - Alessio, found trying not to be biased in writing the profile, would find it helpful to discuss, Hanno, agreed that there is some guess work. Have a better idea of whether the profiles are accurate after the first workshop. 
            - [name=toby] +1 to this! you should go back and check whether your profiles were an accurate representation of the people who attended your workshop.
        - Richard, I know people who fall into the target audience for my lesson, so could base the profile on them.
        - Hanno, can you make them specific enough with this approach?
        -  (Graeme?), I wrote two for different career stages/groups who fall into the target audience. Use imagination to add "colour" to the facts.
        - Bailey, everyone has different background experience.
        - Richard, yes there are a lot of different backgrounds and a handful fo profiles can't capture all of this.
        - Hanno, helps recognise that a heterogeneous group will be harder to teach to
        - Annajiat, different motivatons for different people attending. profiles help us identify what will excite and motivate these different people. Asks how many learner profiles would be needed (see question below)
        - Sarah adds, it helps to think about the heterogeneity of the audience and develop empathy towards the audience.
        - Hanno, asks its not about the accuracy of the profile
        - Toby, replies, writing a plausible profile helps you to see if a your lesson is realistic for the audience.
        - Annajiat, we can use leaner profiles to inform our lesson development. 
    - What are some of the potential benefits of writing specific learner profiles rather than stopping after answering the audience definition questions?
        - Alessio - writing bullet points is easier but doesn't give character in the way that a profile does
        - Sarah - scope, it helps you to question will the audience know this, is this realistic to teach.
    - What are some of the potential downsides?
    - Did characterising its target audience change how you plan to approach writing your lesson?
    - How many different learner profiles do you think you could write for your lesson?
        - Annajiat 3 or 4
        - Graeme 2, one beginner, 1 more advanced. Suggested it would be good to have a collection of profiles you could use.
        - Bailey, 1, but I also wrote out lists of potential student levels, goals, and types of experience people interested in my course might have.
        - Annajiat, have learner profiles available for learners so that they connect to the lesson
        - Toby replied, the opposite has been raised as if learners do not see a profile matching them they can be put off from joining a coures.
        - Toby typically writes 4 or 5
    - What are some of the challenges of writing a lesson aimed at novices?
        - Graeme, its easier to write profiles for extroverts in lessons rather than more introveted participants who just get on with things.
        - Bailey, has used student survey feedback to get a sense of what students want.
    - What are some of the challenges of writing a lesson aimed at people with some prior knowledge of the topic domain e.g. an intermediate programming lesson?
        - Annajiat, diverse set of expectations
        - Richard - some people will have some implicit experience of what we are teaching, something they've been doing but not formally taught so they mighth have some conceptual idea of what we want to do
        - Sarah, this can give a connection point to your learners. It gives you something you can build upon if you have an idea of what their experiences (of what you're teaching) might be.
        - Toby, this also means people may have developed habits which complete beginners won't have. 
        - Annajiat, if people have some background you could have a group at different levels.
        - Bailey, to address this, you need to be explicit about what you plan to teach and to avoid disappointment.
        - Sarah, for an intermediate group you need to think about the experience they are coming with.
        - Toby, write more exercises than you realistically have time for in case anyone is progressing faster than the rest of the group. 
        - Sarah, flag up "challenge" questions that you know are bit more complex/require a bit of a jump
        - Annajiat, also helps with motivation - students often want to be challenged 
    
- Homework:
  - Read the [Technological Introductions chapter of the CDH](https://cdh.carpentries.org/technological-introductions.html) and follow the steps to set up your repository as described in the template README file.
  - Read [section A.2 of CDH Appendix A: The Carpentries Incubator](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-carpentries-incubator.html), and add topics to your lesson repository. (If you cannot add the complete set of topic tags yet, do not worry: you will be able to add more and remove topics whenever you like.)
  - Note down any questions you have about the lesson template and, if you got stuck, how far you had progressed with the setup beforehand.
  - Add a link to your lesson repository to the Study Groupâ€™s shared notes document.

## Main Texts

During the program, Study Groups will read and discuss a range of resources
relevant to the development of Carpentries lessons.
Two resources central to the program are:

- [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook][cdh]
  - Often abbreviated to CDH, the Curriculum Development Handbook provides
  a practical overview of the important steps in lesson development,
  focusing on how those steps relate to the processes and infrastructure
  of The Carpentries.
- [Teaching Tech Together][ttt] by Greg Wilson
  - A more comprehensive review of good practices in lesson development,
  teaching, and community building.

Other resources will be linked throughout the site,
and [the Further Reading page](../further_reading/) lists some recommended resources
for those who wish to explore beyond the program's required reading.

## Session Format

Study Groups will meet each week* for an hour-long discussion of the lesson development process.
Each session will have associated reading and homework tasks, which every participant is expected to complete.
We estimate that these tasks will take an additional 2-3 hours, making **a total of ~3-4 hours of work each week for Study Group participants**.

Reading and homework tasks are described on the individual session pages listed under the _Episodes_ menu above.

\*there will be a two-week interval between sessions 7 and 8, to allow time for participants to complete a trial run
teaching one of the episodes from their lesson.

## Roles

Every weekly discussion session will have a Discussion Lead, a Notetaker and one or more Group Facilitators.
The roles of the Discussion Lead and the Notetaker will rotate weekly between group participants. 

### Discussion Lead
The Facilitator is responsible for leading the group through a discussion
of the reading material for this session.
They should ensure every group member has an equal opportunity to contribute
to the discussion, and that the discussion is completed in a timely manner.
They also take notes when the Notetaker is speaking. The role rotates weekly.

### Notetaker
Notetaker is responsible for ensuring that the key points of the discussion are noted. They may do this all themselves or call for help from others e.g. the Group Facilitator. It is important that the Notetaker is also able to contribute to the discussion, so the Discussion Lead should cover notes when the Notetaker is speaking.
The Notetaker also ensures that a copy of the notes is uploaded to the carpentries-incubator/study-groups GitHub repository before the start of the next session. The role rotates weekly.

### Group Facilitator
Group Facilitator is a person with experience of the lesson development process and infrastructure. One or more Group Facilitators will be present each week to 
facilitate the discussions, answer any questions and help group participants with the lesson development process.
